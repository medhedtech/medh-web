# Changes Made by Cursor - Currency Conversion Implementation

## Summary
Added region-based currency conversion functionality to the Medh ed-tech platform. Users can now view prices in their local currency based on their region or manually select their preferred currency. Additionally, implemented support for both batch and individual pricing options with interactive price selection.

## New Files Created
- `src/contexts/CurrencyContext.js`: Context provider for currency conversion and management
- `src/components/shared/currency/CurrencySelector.js`: Component for selecting currency
- `src/utils/priceUtils.js`: Utility functions for price formatting and calculations

## Modified Files
- `src/app/Providers.js`: Added CurrencyProvider to the application's provider stack
- `src/components/layout/header/NavbarRight.js`: Added CurrencySelector to the navbar
- `src/components/shared/course-details/CourseEnroll.js`: Updated to use currency context for price display
- `src/components/shared/courses/CourseCard.js`: Updated to display both batch and individual pricing with currency conversion
- `src/components/layout/main/dashboards/CourseHeader.js`: Updated to display batch and individual pricing options with interactive pricing selector
- `src/components/sections/courses/CourseCard.js`: Updated to display batch and individual pricing with currency conversion
- `src/components/layout/main/dashboards/CourseDetails.js`: Modified to pass batch and individual pricing data to CourseHeader

## Important Files and Routes
- `/contexts/CurrencyContext.js`: Main context for currency management
- `/components/shared/currency/CurrencySelector.js`: UI for currency selection
- `/utils/priceUtils.js`: Price utility functions
- `/components/shared/course-details/CourseEnroll.js`: Display of course prices on course detail pages
- `/components/shared/courses/CourseCard.js`: Display of course prices in grid/list views
- `/components/layout/main/dashboards/CourseHeader.js`: Main component for displaying batch/individual pricing options

## New Features
- **Batch and Individual Pricing**: Users can now choose between batch enrollment (group discount) and individual enrollment prices
- **Interactive Price Selection**: Added tabs to switch between pricing options
- **Discount Display**: Shows savings percentage for batch pricing compared to individual pricing
- **Per-Student Pricing**: Clearly indicates batch pricing is per student with minimum batch size requirements

## Project Details
- **Design Consistency**: The pricing selector maintains the same design language as the currency selector with tabs and clear visual hierarchy
- **API Structure**: The pricing data structure now includes separate fields for batch and individual pricing
- **Coding Technique**: Uses React state management for price selection, reusable pricing utility functions, and responsive design principles

## Future Improvements
- Integrate with a real-time currency conversion API to get up-to-date exchange rates
- Add more currencies to the available options
- Cache exchange rates for better performance
- Display prices in multiple currencies on admin dashboard
- Implement batch enrollment form to collect information about all students in a group
- Add dynamic pricing tiers based on batch size (larger batches get bigger discounts)
