# Changes Made by Cursor - Currency Conversion Implementation

## Summary
Added region-based currency conversion functionality to the Medh ed-tech platform. Users can now view prices in their local currency based on their region or manually select their preferred currency.

## New Files Created
- `src/contexts/CurrencyContext.js`: Context provider for currency conversion and management
- `src/components/shared/currency/CurrencySelector.js`: Component for selecting currency
- `src/utils/priceUtils.js`: Utility functions for price formatting and calculations

## Modified Files
- `src/app/Providers.js`: Added CurrencyProvider to the application's provider stack
- `src/components/layout/header/NavbarRight.js`: Added CurrencySelector to the navbar
- `src/components/shared/course-details/CourseEnroll.js`: Updated to use currency context for price display
- `src/components/shared/courses/CourseCard.js`: Updated to use currency context for price display
- `src/components/layout/main/dashboards/CourseHeader.js`: Updated to use currency context for price display
- `src/components/sections/courses/CourseCard.js`: Updated to use currency context for price display

## Important Files and Routes
- `/contexts/CurrencyContext.js`: Main context for currency management
- `/components/shared/currency/CurrencySelector.js`: UI for currency selection
- `/utils/priceUtils.js`: Price utility functions
- `/components/shared/course-details/CourseEnroll.js`: Display of course prices on course detail pages
- `/components/shared/courses/CourseCard.js`: Display of course prices in grid/list views

## Project Details
- **Design Consistency**: The currency selector maintains the overall design aesthetics of the platform with a clean, minimal UI that follows the existing color scheme.
- **API Structure**: The currency conversion is done client-side for now, but can be easily updated to use a real-time currency API.
- **Coding Technique**: Uses React Context API for state management, hooks for component functionality, and utility functions for reusable code.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate with a real-time currency conversion API to get up-to-date exchange rates
- Add more currencies to the available options
- Cache exchange rates for better performance
- Display prices in multiple currencies on admin dashboard
