- **Expandable/collapsible weeks** to focus on one section at a time
- **Simplified form fields** with inline editing

### 2. Reduced Cognitive Load
- **Fewer steps** to add content
- **Streamlined input fields** that only show what's necessary
- **Curriculum overview** with at-a-glance statistics
- **Quick tips** to guide users through the process

### 3. Enhanced UX Features
- **Auto-scrolling** to newly added items
- **Improved drag-and-drop** system
- **Inline editing** of titles without separate modals
- **Confirmation dialogs** for destructive actions

### 4. Mobile-Friendly Design
- **Responsive layout** that works on all screen sizes
- **Touch-friendly** buttons and controls
- **Simplified interactions** for touchscreen usage

## Implementation Details

The new `SimpleCurriculum` component maintains the same data structure and API as the original `CourseCurriculum` component, ensuring backward compatibility while providing a much better user experience.

### Key Differences

| Feature | Old CourseCurriculum | New SimpleCurriculum |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| UI Complexity | Complex, overwhelming | Simple, intuitive |
| Editing Experience | Multiple nested forms | Inline editing |
| Visual Guidance | Minimal | Color-coded, visual cues |
| Mobile Experience | Poor | Fully responsive |
| Learning Curve | Steep | Gentle, guided |
| User Feedback | Minimal | Immediate visual feedback |

## Usage

The component is a drop-in replacement for the old `CourseCurriculum` component:

```tsx
import SimpleCurriculum from '@/components/course/steps/SimpleCurriculum';

// Then in your component:
<SimpleCurriculum
  register={register}
  setValue={setValue}
  formState={formState}
  watch={watch}
/>
```

## Future Improvements

- Add animated transitions for a more polished feel
- Implement a "preview" mode to see how the curriculum will look to students
- Add templates for common curriculum structures that can be applied with one click
- Implement a progress tracker to show completion status of curriculum building
