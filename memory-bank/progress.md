## Recent Fixes (December 2024)
1. **Authentication Token Refresh Issue**
   - **Problem**: Refresh token requests were failing with "MISSING_REFRESH_TOKEN" error
   - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent implementation across multiple files - some were sending empty request bodies, others were using expired access tokens in Authorization headers
   - **Solution**: Standardized all refresh token implementations to send `{ refresh_token: refreshTokenValue }` in request body
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/apis/apiClient.ts`
     - `src/utils/apiWithAuth.ts` 
     - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - **Impact**: Resolves authentication failures and improves user session management

2. **Course Creation Form - Lesson Management Issue**
   - **Problem**: Lesson section in course creation forms (Free, Live, Blended) was not working properly - lesson fields not updating, add/remove functionality broken
   - **Root Cause**: 
     - Blended course: Complex 3-level nested array handling (`curriculum[moduleIndex].lessons[lessonIndex]`) was not properly implemented
     - Array manipulation functions couldn't handle the nested structure correctly
     - Missing lesson description field in blended course form
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created specialized helper functions for lesson management: `handleLessonChange`, `addLessonToModule`, `removeLessonFromModule`
     - Enhanced `handleArrayInputChange` to support 3-level nesting
     - Added missing lesson description field in blended course form
     - Fixed duration field parsing with fallback to 0
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/app/dashboards/admin/courses/create/blended/page.tsx`
   - **Impact**: Course creation forms now work properly with full lesson management functionality

3. **Infinite Re-render Issue in Course Details Page (FIXED AGAIN - December 2024)**
   - **Problem**: Course details page was still experiencing infinite loops despite previous fixes
   - **Root Cause**: 
     - `getLocationCurrency` function was recreated on every render due to `searchParams` dependency
     - `fetchCourse` function depended on `getLocationCurrency`, causing infinite loop
     - `useEffect` in EnrollmentDetails was including `getActivePrice` in dependencies, causing re-renders
     - Another `useEffect` was setting `enrollmentType` while having `enrollmentType` in dependencies
   - **Solution**: 
     - **LATEST FIX**: Completely restructured currency detection logic:
       - Moved currency detection to a one-time `useEffect` that runs only on mount (`[]` dependency)
       - Separated currency initialization from course fetching
       - Course fetching now only depends on `[courseId, userCurrency, getQuery]`
       - Removed `getLocationCurrency` callback entirely to eliminate dependency chain
     - Removed unstable dependencies from useCallback and useEffect hooks
     - Fixed circular dependencies in EnrollmentDetails component
     - Stabilized state updates to prevent infinite loops
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/app/course-details/[courseId]/page.tsx` (MAJOR RESTRUCTURE)
     - `src/components/sections/course-detailed/EnrollmentDetails.tsx`
   - **Impact**: Course details page now loads without infinite re-renders, improving performance and user experience
