5. Performance Optimizations
   - Server-side rendering
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting implementation
   - Caching strategies

## Recent Fixes (December 2024)
1. **Authentication Token Refresh Issue**
   - **Problem**: Refresh token requests were failing with "MISSING_REFRESH_TOKEN" error
   - **Root Cause**: Inconsistent implementation across multiple files - some were sending empty request bodies, others were using expired access tokens in Authorization headers
   - **Solution**: Standardized all refresh token implementations to send `{ refresh_token: refreshTokenValue }` in request body
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/apis/apiClient.ts`
     - `src/utils/apiWithAuth.ts` 
     - `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`
   - **Impact**: Resolves authentication failures and improves user session management

2. **Course Creation Form - Lesson Management Issue**
   - **Problem**: Lesson section in course creation forms (Free, Live, Blended) was not working properly - lesson fields not updating, add/remove functionality broken
   - **Root Cause**: 
     - Blended course: Complex 3-level nested array handling (`curriculum[moduleIndex].lessons[lessonIndex]`) was not properly implemented
     - Array manipulation functions couldn't handle the nested structure correctly
     - Missing lesson description field in blended course form
   - **Solution**: 
     - Created specialized helper functions for lesson management: `handleLessonChange`, `addLessonToModule`, `removeLessonFromModule`
     - Enhanced `handleArrayInputChange` to support 3-level nesting
     - Added missing lesson description field in blended course form
     - Fixed duration field parsing with fallback to 0
   - **Files Updated**:
     - `src/app/dashboards/admin/courses/create/blended/page.tsx`
   - **Impact**: Course creation forms now work properly with full lesson management functionality
