# API Integration

## Overview
The API Integration layer provides a consistent interface for communicating with the backend services. It handles data fetching, error handling, caching, and transformation of API responses to component-friendly formats.

## Components
1. API Client
   - Located at: `src/utils/api.ts`
   - Centralized API client
   - Request/response interceptors
   - Error handling
   - Caching mechanism

2. API Endpoints
   - Located at: `src/apis/index.ts`
   - Organized by feature
   - Type-safe endpoints
   - Parameter validation
   - Response typing

3. Custom Hooks
   - Located at: `src/hooks/useApi.ts`
   - Data fetching hooks
   - Loading state management
   - Error state management
   - Cache invalidation

## Data Flow
1. Request Flow
   - Component triggers API call
   - Request goes through interceptors
   - Request is sent to backend
   - Response is processed

2. Response Flow
   - Response is received
   - Response goes through interceptors
   - Data is transformed
   - Component receives data

3. Error Flow
   - Error is caught
   - Error is processed
   - Error is logged
   - Error is returned to component

## API Structure
1. Endpoints
   - `/api/courses/*` for course-related endpoints
   - `/api/blogs/*` for blog-related endpoints
   - `/api/users/*` for user-related endpoints
   - `/api/auth/*` for authentication endpoints

2. Request Format
   ```typescript
   interface ApiRequest<T> {
     endpoint: string;
     method: 'GET' | 'POST' | 'PUT' | 'DELETE';
     data?: T;
     params?: Record<string, string>;
     headers?: Record<string, string>;
   }
   ```

3. Response Format
   ```typescript
   interface ApiResponse<T> {
     data: T;
     status: number;
     message: string;
   }
   ```

## Technical Implementation
1. Data Fetching
   - SWR for data fetching
   - React Query for complex data
   - Axios for HTTP requests
   - Fetch API for simple requests

2. Caching
   - In-memory caching
   - Persistent caching
   - Cache invalidation
   - Stale-while-revalidate

3. Error Handling
   - Global error boundary
   - API error interceptors
   - Retry mechanism
   - Fallback UI

## Performance Optimization
1. Request Optimization
   - Request debouncing
   - Request throttling
   - Request cancellation
   - Request batching

2. Response Optimization
   - Response compression
   - Response caching
   - Response transformation
   - Response pagination

3. Cache Optimization
   - Cache strategies
   - Cache invalidation
   - Cache persistence
   - Cache synchronization

## Known Issues
1. Performance
   - Some endpoints are slow
   - Large responses cause performance issues
   - Cache invalidation is not optimal

2. Error Handling
   - Some errors are not properly handled
   - Error messages are not user-friendly
   - Retry mechanism needs improvement

3. Type Safety
   - Some endpoints lack proper typing
   - Response types are not consistent
   - Parameter validation is incomplete

## Future Enhancements
1. API Improvements
   - GraphQL integration
   - WebSocket support
   - Batch requests
   - Real-time updates

2. Performance Enhancements
   - Advanced caching
   - Request optimization
   - Response optimization
   - Connection pooling

3. Developer Experience
   - API documentation
   - API testing tools
   - API mocking
   - API versioning
