### Adding Cookie Status Indicator
```tsx
import CookieConsentIndicator from '@/components/shared/gdpr/CookieConsentIndicator';

// In header (compact mode)
<CookieConsentIndicator compact={true} position="header" />

// In footer (full mode)
<CookieConsentIndicator position="footer" />
```

### Accessing Cookie Settings
```tsx
import { useCookieConsent } from '@/contexts/CookieConsentContext';

function MyComponent() {
  const { cookieSettings, reopenCookieSettings } = useCookieConsent();
  
  // Check if analytics cookies are enabled
  if (cookieSettings.analytics) {
    // Initialize analytics
  }
  
  // Reopen settings panel
  const handleCookieSettings = () => {
    reopenCookieSettings();
  };
}
```
